- 👋 Hi, I’m @amadoguloy
- 👀 I’m  interested in developing solutions that use big (or small) data, particularly in industries with interesting data sets like health, agriculture, logistics, and other “traditional industries.”. Personally, I’m concerned and speak about issues as related to diversity and inclusion, mental health of tech workers and entrepreneurs, and climate change.In the meantime, I also act as a scout and venture partner for a few venture capital firms in the US and abroad. If you're looking for pre-seed and seed funding and fit within my interests, then please reach out.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ALL THE THINGS! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects really!
