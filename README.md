- 👋 Hi, I’m @amadoguloy
- 👀 I’m  interested in developing solutions that use big (or small) data, particularly in industries with interesting data sets like health, agriculture, chemical, logistics, and other “traditional industries.”. Some of these projects are purely mine, whereas other pojects are ones that I've contributed something (usually trying to make a web-based GUI) to. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ALL THE THINGS! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects really!
- 📫 How to reach me : amadoguloy@gmail.com
